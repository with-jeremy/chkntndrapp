# Product Context: Restaurant Matcher

## Purpose & Problem Statement
Restaurant Matcher addresses the common problem of indecision and disagreement when couples or friends are trying to decide where to eat. It's inspired by the classic scenario: "Where do you want to eat?" followed by "I don't care," but then having all suggestions rejected. By turning restaurant selection into a swiping game similar to dating apps, the application makes the decision process fun while ensuring both parties genuinely agree on the final choice.

## User Personas

### Primary Users: Couples and Friends
- **Needs**: A way to efficiently decide on a restaurant that both parties actually want
- **Pain Points**: Circular conversations, decision paralysis, false agreements to end the discussion
- **Goals**: Find a restaurant they both genuinely like without the typical decision friction

### Secondary User: Groups
- **Needs**: Democratic way to choose dining options
- **Pain Points**: Difficulty accommodating everyone's preferences
- **Goals**: Find common ground in dining preferences efficiently
